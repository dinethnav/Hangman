# Hangman
This is basically a small game which the computer picks a word and we have to guess the words.
There are number of lives that are given according to the difficulty level that we have chosen and one wrong guess will take away one life. Game will end either if we guess the corrrect word or if we lost all the lives.

This is a very basic python code.
